# Creating Schematics

## 1. Create a Selection

* Open Litematica's Menu `M`.
* Open the `Area Selection Browser`.
* Click `New Selection`.
* Name your selection.
    * Give it a descriptive name - this name will be given to any schematic created from this selection.
* Press `Esc` to exit back to Litematica's main menu.

## 2. Selecting the Area

* Hold the `Tool Item` in your hand. *(by default this is a stick but the item can be configured in `Generic >> Tool Item`)*
* Holding the `Tool Item` should show an information HUD at the bottom left of the screen. If you do not see the HUD, take a look at the [`Common Problems`](#common-problems) section.

* You want to be in `Area Selection` mode. Holding `CTRL` and scrolling with the mouse wheel will cycle through the available modes.
* Select the area you want to be contained within your schematic by left clicking the outermost corner of your build and right clicking the opposite corner. This will render a selection box around your selected area.
    * A temporary block can be placed at the corner of your build in order to make the selection easier *(just remember to remove it before saving you selection)*.
    * After making a selection you can use the "Nudge" feature to adjust the position of your corners by holding down `ALT` and scrolling with the mouse wheel. This will move the selected corner towards/away from the direction you are facing.
    Select the corner you wish to nudge by looking at it and clicking the middle mouse button.
